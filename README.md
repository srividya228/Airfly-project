# ✈️ AirFly Insights: Data Visualization and Analysis of Airline Operations

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze **large-scale airline flight data** to uncover operational trends, delay patterns, and cancellation reasons using **data visualization techniques**.  
The insights aim to support stakeholders like **airline operators, airports, and analysts** in understanding performance and making **data-driven decisions**.

## 🎯 Objectives & Expected Outcomes
- ✅ Understand and preprocess aviation datasets for analysis  
- ✅ Explore trends in flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and routes  
- ✅ Visualize key metrics using bar charts, time series, heatmaps, and maps  
- ✅ Provide actionable insights for stakeholders  
- ✅ Summarize findings through a final **visual report/dashboard**
